# as a side note:
should the wemos shield not work even after the firmware upgrade (https://hackaday.io/project/18439-motor-shield-reprogramming/discussion-70680?page=1)
check for I2C/IO solder pads on the bottom of the shield

_"Never mind. I read aarn_a comment and seems like this one also had the IO pad soldered for standby mode. I unsoldered it and soldered the I2C pads and everything works now. I didn't think to look there as all documentation said that I2C is standard/default on these boards for standby mode."_
